The latitude and longitude values appear as null values during conversion from dict to XML as well as JSON to XML. 
I've tried a few approaches with libraries and manual coding the XML format. Have enclosed all of them in the code
but they all gave me the same result. 

I believe that the conversion isn't recognised at all when it's converted to XML format. 
Would love to know if there was a proper approach to this!
